# ASPNet-WPF-ChatApp

This project is chat app using the MVVM  pattern (Model-View-ViewModel), which is a refinement of the MVC pattern (Model-View-Controller).
It was created by following AngelSix's WPF/ASP.Net tutorial series on YouTube, starting at video #4: "C# WPF UI Tutorials: 04 - Custom Window Chrome and Styles" 
in this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDOxHx-AMqQ&list=PLrW43fNmjaQVYF4zgsD0oL9Iv6u23PI6M&index=4).

The backend web server for this project was built by following his MVC [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrW43fNmjaQUBZv0OiliNY4fStb4Vj1u4).

For both playlists, each video has a link to the source code for that video on Github.
